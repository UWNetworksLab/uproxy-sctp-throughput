#+TITLE: Sctp Throughput Benchmark

* Issues
** Looks like I've got to sort out this whole identifier issue.
   Uses:
   - [X] usrsctp_register_address
   - [X] usersctp_socket
   - [X] usersctp_socket
   - [X] usrsctp_conninput
   - [X] usrsctp_connect (in the sockaddr_conn)
   - [X] usrsctp_bind (in the sockaddr_conn)
** Well, that didn't do it.
   - perhaps I need two identifiers, one for each endpoint
     Fuuuck.
     - OK, how do I tell the recipient for usrsctp_conninput? (e.g.,
       the first arg)
     - Do I have ot use two FDs?  That may make sense.  But then
       there's the issue of mapping it all together...

       - Ok, so, two FDs, each in a different io_endpoint struct.
       - The handle_packets routine calls select() on the FDs and
         passes appropriately.
       - Make sense.
   - there's the matter of sendto() and recvfrom().
** Current trace
*** usrsctp_connect: connection refused
    :PROPERTIES:
    :LOCATION: sctp_input.c:5826
    :END:

    - Getting hit with 'inp == NULL' branch in
      sctp_common_input_processing.  It will always 'goto out' and
      abort.
      - sctp_findassociation_addr fills inp, and doesn't in this case.
**** sctp_findassociation_addr
     - calling sctp_findassociation_addr_sa
     - which calls sctp_pcb_findep
       - sctp_endpoint_probe is ultimately responsible, as it the
         input arg find_tcp_pool is zero.
***** sctp_endpoint_probe
      - its 'head' has value { lh_first = 0x0 }, so the LIST_FOREACH
        on line 1947 doesn't iterate.
      - All the lists in 'sctp_ephash' seem to be NULL.  I haven't
        verified all of them yet, but it looks pretty clear.
        - Does a listen do that?
      - system_base_info.sctppcbinfo.sctp_ephash
***** Nope, a bad port number.  I reversed the fucker twice.
*** verify_data is getting back a bad set of args.
    The 'buffer' arg is fucked, and I can't help but notice two
    things:
    1. The argument before it is union sctp_sockstore
    2. That union has more than one definition in usrsctplib.
** sctp blackhole ??
   https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-stewart-tsvwg-sctp-ipv4-00#page-5
   Describes black-holes, and the sysctl.
* Things to Remember
** usrsctp is built without INET/INET6 support in chromium/webrtc
   That may be a unique source of issues if a high-throughput stress
   test doesn't find anything.
